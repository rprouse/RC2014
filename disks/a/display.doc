                     Display, Ver.1.0

                          as of

                     October 30, 1980


 DISPLAY.COM  allows  displaying  an ASCII file on  a  24  line 
terminal,  with  commands similar to Digital Research's  ED.COM 
(but without any of the editing facilities).


                     Using DISPLAY.COM


 For  example:  DISPLAY  FILENAME.TXT<cr>   ,will  envoke   the 
display   program   and   load  the  entire   secondary   entry 
(FILENAME.TXT) into memory, for subsequent display of the first 
23 lines of that file. Various commands can then be issued from 
the terminal keyboard which will manipulate the display of  the 
file.

 The  commands shown below with a preceding "n" indicates  that 
an  optional unsigned integer value can be specified to  envoke 
"n" iterations of the command.  When a command is preceded by a 
"-"  sign,  the  command  will cause display of the file  in  a 
direction  towards  the start of  the  file.  Unsigned  integer 
values  are  assumed  to be positive  values  (i.e.,  "+")  and 
therefore  "+" need not be specified. Also, the buffer  pointer 
will stop display at the top or bottom of the file if too large 
a value of "n" is specified.
