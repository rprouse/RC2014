THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTS THE RULES AND OPTIONS OF THE GAMES 'STARTREK.TXT' AND
'BIGTREK'.


OBJECTIVE - UNLIKE MOST OTHER STARTREKS, DESTROYING THE KLINGON FLEET IS ONLY
A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE; THIS GAME FEATURES A VERY COMPREHENSIVE SCORING ROU-
TINE, AND THE REAL OBJECTIVE IS TO GET THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SCORE (NOT UNLIKE
A PINBALL MACHINE).

START OF GAME - WHEN THIS GAME SIGNS ON, IT ASKS: "MISSION DURATION ?"; ANSWER
'S', 'M' OR 'L' (SHORT MEDIUM OR LONG). IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE SHORT GAMES
CAN BE VERY, VERY SHORT. NEXT IT ASKS "ARE YOU A BEGINNER, NOVICE, SENIOR OR
EXPERT; ANSWER 'B', 'N', 'S' OR 'E', ALSO WORTH NOTING, IF YOU REPLY 'B' THE
GAME STARTS OUT GIVING THE PLAYER MORE INFORMATION THAN IS AVAILABLE IN ANY OF
THE OTHER THREE MODES. THEN IT REQUESTS YOUR "MISSION PASSWORD"; REMEMBER WHAT
YOU REPLY HERE; YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW THE WORD TO SELF DESTRUCT (WHICH DUE TO
THE EMPHASIS ON POINTS SCORED IS OFTEN THE WISEST OPTION). FINALLY YOU WILL BE
ASKED, "READY TO CONTINUE ?"; ENTER ANY CHARACTER AND HIT RETURN.

NAVIGATION, PHOTON AIMING ETC. - THE COORDINATES USED ARE JUST EXACTLY LIKE
THE NUMBERS ON A CLOCK FACE (12 O'CLOCK AT THE TOP) N.B.!!! IF YOU WANT TO
TRAVEL OR AIM A PHOTON STRAIGHT UP, ENTER COURSE 12 (NOT COURSE 0); FAILURE
TO OBSERVE THIS PRECAUTION WILL LEAD TO AN OCCASIONAL DIVISION BY ZERO ERROR,
AND YOU WILL HAVE LOST THE GAME IN PROGRESS. (NOTE - I INSERTED SEVERAL TRAPS
FOR THIS, BUT I VERY LIKELY MISSED SOME ALSO. Z.) FINALLY IT GOES WITHOUT
SAYING THAT IF YOU WANTED TO TRAVEL ON A COURSE EXACTLY HALF WAY BETWEEN NOON
AND 3:00 O'CLOCK, THE CORRECT COURSE WOULD BE 1.5 (NOT 1:30).

WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THE QUADRANTS:

E:	THE ENTERPRISE
K:	KLINGON BATTLE CRUISER
O:	ORGANIAN TRUCE-MONITOR VESSEL-SPACE WARPS OFTEN ACCOMPANY THESE.
	(SHOOT THEM JUST FOR PRACTISE).  
C:	COMMANDER-MAY BE YOURS, MAY BE ENEMY'S. LONG RANGE SCAN WILL TELL
	YOU WHICH (IF YOU COUNT TOTAL ENEMY IN QUADRANT).
F:	THE FAERIE QUEENE-AN OLD STARSHIP WHICH YOU CAN SOMETIMES USE AFTER
	ENTERPRISE HAS BEEN ABANDONED OR CRIPPLED.
*:	STARS-IF THEY ARE IN YOUR WAY, YOU CAN SHOOT THEM WITH YOUR PHOTONS,
	THERE IS A MINOR PENALTY FOR THIS. (THEY 'NOVA' WHEN DESTROYED.) IF
	YOU ARE TOO CLOSE TO A STAR WHEN YOU SHOOT IT, THE FORCE OF THE NOVA
	MAY WELL DESTROY THE ENTERPRISE.
?	THIS MEANS YOU ARE TRYING TO VIEW BEYOND QUADRANT BOUNDARY WITH THE
	VISUAL-SENSORS (SEE BELOW).
***:	SUPER-NOVA - AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS !!!

EACH QUADRANT IS A 10 BY 10 GRID, WHICH CAN BE EXACTLY TRANSVERSED EITHER IN A
HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL (NOT DIAGONAL) DIRECTION WITH A WARP FACTOR OF 1. THE
CORRECT WARP FACTOR FOR FULL DIAGONAL TRANSVERSE IS 1.4142 (2^0.5) [IN BASIC].

			*** COMMAND LEVEL ***

EACH OF THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS MUST BE ENTERED AS TWO (OR MORE) SIGNIFICANT
LETTERS FOLLOWED BY <CR>. (THE 20 COMMAND-LEVEL OPTIONS)

AB-ABANDON
ABANDON SHIP - SACRIFICE THE ENTERPRISE AND (IF YOU STILL HAVE OPERATIONAL
SHUTTLE CRAFT) PROCEED AS CAPTAIN OF THE FAERIE QUEENE.

CH-CHART
CUMULATIVE GALACTIC MAP-EACH 'WINDOW' IS OPENED BY USE OF THE LRSENSORS. UNLIKE
THE USUAL ONES, THIS ONE ALWAYS SHOWS YOU WHERE THE STARBASES AND SUPERNOVAS
ARE LOCATED.

CO-COMPUTER
LIBRARY COMPUTER - SEE COMMAND SUMMARY BELOW

DA-DAMAGES
DAMAGE CONTROL/REPAIR. GET A FEEL FOR THIS BY PLAYING.
	WHAT DAMAGE CONTROL/REPAIR REFERENCES:
		SRSENSORS
		LRSENSORS
		PHASERS
		PHOTON TUBES
		LIFE SUPPORT
		WARP ENGINES
		IMPULSE ENGINES
		SHIELDS
		SUBSPACE-RADIO
		SHUTTLE CRAFT
		COMPUTER
		TRANSFER PANEL
	NOTE: THE ABOVE DO NOT ALL NECESSARILY CORRESPOND TO THE TWENTY
	COMMAND-LEVEL OPTIONS.

DE-DESTRUCT
SELF-DESTRUCT SERVOS. REMEMBER PASSWORD YOU ENTERED AT BEGINNING.

DO-DOCK
WHAT YOU MUST DO WHEN ADJACENT TO A STARBASE, UNLIKE MOST OTHER 'STARTREKS',
THIS MUST BE SPECIFICALLY COMMANDED; IT IS NOT AUTOMATIC.

ID-IDLE
IDLE ENGINES - KILL TIME WHILE WAITING FOR REPAIRS TO BE COMPLETED. THIS
COMMAND IS NULLIFIED WHEN A TRACTOR-BEAM LOCKS ONTO YOUR STARSHIP.

IM-IMPULSE
IMPULSE ENGINES - USE THESE WHEN WARP ENGINES ARE OUT (THEY ARE FAR LESS
ENERGY-EFFICIENT). ALSO CERTAIN STARS HAVE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES, AND IN SUCH
CASES YOU MUST USE IMPULSE ENGINES TO BREAK FREE.

LR-LRSCAN
LONG RANGE SCANNERS - WORKS AS YOU WOULD EXPECT.

NA-NAVIGATE
MOVE YOUR STARSHIP THROUGH SPACE.

PH-PHASERS
PHASER BANKS. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE DIRECTED AT ENEMY IN ANOTHER
QUADRANT (SEE PEFFECT BELOW).

QU-QUIT
TERMINATE GAME WITHOUT SCORING.

SH-SHIELDS
LOWERS RAISED SHIELDS OR RAISES LOWERED SHIELDS. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHEN
AND HOW TO USE THIS AFTER A FEW GAMES.

SO-SOS
CALL A STARBASE FOR HELP (THIS INVOLVES A POINT-PENALTY).

SR-SRSCAN
SHORT RANGE SCANNERS - THE USUAL, BUT ALSO INVOKES LRSCAN (IF OPERATIONAL).

ST-STATUS
STATUS REPORT OF GAME IN PROGRESS. (MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN USUAL)

TO-TORPEDO
PHOTON TORPEDOS - CAN BE FIRED SINGLY OR IN BURSTS OF THREE. THE LATTER OP-
TION IS RECOMMENDED WHEN TRYING TO DESTROY A KLINGON COMMANDER (THEY HAVE
SUPERIOR DEFENSIVE CAPABILITIES).

TR-TRANSFER
TRANSFER PANEL - ALLOWS THE TRANSFER OF ENERGY TO AND FROM PHASER BANKS.

VI-VISUAL
VERY SHORT RANGE SCANNER - USEFUL FOR LIMITED NAVIGATION WHEN SRSCANNERS ARE
NON-FUNCTIONAL. A VERY CUTE OPTION.

WA-WARP
THIS DICTATES CERTAIN PARAMATERS FOR QUADRANT TO QUADRANT TRAVEL WHEN ENGINES
(NAVIGATIONAL OR IMPULSE) ARE DAMAGED. YOU WILL BE ADVISED WHEN TO USE THIS
COMMAND (WASTEFUL TO USE IT OTHERWISE).

			*** COMPUTER OPTIONS ***

THESE MAY BE INVOKED WITH A SINGLE LETTER.

C-COURSE
GIVES EXACT BEARINGS AND DISTANCES (WARP FACTORS) FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE TO
ANYWHERE ELSE IN GALAXY. INVALUABLE FOR LONG PHOTON SHOTS. NOTE THAT THE DATA
MUST BE GIVEN IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT: IF YOU WISH TO FIND COURSE AND DISTANCE
TO QUADRANT 3-2, SECTOR 4-10, THE CORRECT INPUT IS '32,0410'. NO OTHER SYSTEM
OF ENTRY IS ACCEPTED.

W-WCOST
THIS COMPUTES HOW MUCH ENERGY WILL BE CONSUMED BY A GIVEN DISTANCE OF TRAVEL
WITH THE WARP ENGINES.

I-ICOST
THIS COMPUTES HOW MUCH ENERGY WILL BE CONSUMED BY A GIVEN DISTANCE OF TRAVEL
WITH THE IMPULSE ENGINES.

S-SCORE
THIS GIVES A PLAYER'S CURRENT SCORE AT ANY TIME DURING GAME.

P-PEFFECT
THIS COMPUTES PHASER EFFECTIVENESS AT A GIVEN DISTANCE. WITH EXPERIENCE, IT
HELPS ONE MAKE A GOOD GUESS ABOUT HOW MUCH ENERGY TO ALLOCATE TO PHASERS.

O-OUT
THIS IS COMMAND FOR COMPUTER EXIT. UNTIL THIS COMMAND IS GIVEN, ALL COMMANDS
ONLY REFERENCE COMPUTER OPTIONS.
